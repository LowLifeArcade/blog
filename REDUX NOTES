ACTIONS

actions must be plain object

REDUX THUNK 
this helps with async action creators
async actions happen fast. When you do a fetch or get or whatever it takes a while and teh action will be done before you get the data. So we need this to modify the action


DON"T MUTATE ARRAY

instead we do these commands with 'hi' as the example prop

state.filter(element=> element !== 'hi') // to take elements out of array and make new array which we're supposed to do.

[...state, 'hi'] // to add to array

state.map(el => el === 'hi' ? 'bye':el) //



Updating, adding or removing props from objects:

{...state, name: 'Sam'}

NOTE: // if we have a profile we do this 
const profile = { name: 'Sam' }
undefined
{...profile,name: 'Alex' }
{name: "Alex"}
{...profile, age: 30 }
{name: "Sam", age: 30}

to REMOVE element from object use lodash library
-.omit(profile, 'name')

_memoize makes it so you can make a call and then it will remember that and not make a network call again.

const memoizeGetUser = _.memoize(GetUser)
memoizeGetUser(1)
this will make a networkcall and anytime ran again it has it remembered and doesnt have to make a network call again
